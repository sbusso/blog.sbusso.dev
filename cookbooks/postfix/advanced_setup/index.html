For security purpose as well: we may want to allow only some hosts to use our SMTP relays and block any other clients. Without the proxy protocol, the load-balancer will hide the client IP with its own IP. You would have to maintain whitelists into the load-balancer (which is doable). Thanks to proxy protocol, Postscreen would be aware of the client IP, it means you could maintain lists directly into the MTA.</p><div class="heading-wrapper h2"><h2 id="security">SECURITY</h2><a class="anchor" href="#security" aria-labelledby="security"><span hidden>#</span></a></div><p>To see if an outsider can reach you, run this command:</p><pre><code>telnet relay-test.mail-abuse.org
host relay-test.mail-abuse.org
</code></pre><p>When you make this connection, relay-test.mail-abuse.org performs an online relay test of the machine that made the connection. If your ISP (or your own firewall) doesn't block incoming connections to your box on port 25, then you should see quite a few messages in your log file.</p><pre><code>netstat -t -a | grep LISTEN

lsof -i tcp:25

Postfix has to process each outgoing message even if the server on the other side throws it away (therefore, you can't use this to test the raw performance of your mass mailer unless you connect your mailer directly to smtp-sink).</p><p>The following example sets up an SMTP listener on port 25 of localhost:</p><pre><code>./smtp-sink -c localhost:25 1000
</code></pre><p>Now you can run your client tests.</p><p>If you want to get an idea for how much overhead the network imposes and also get a control experiment to see what the theoretical maximum throughput for a mail server, you can make smtp-source and smtp-sink talk to each other. Open two windows. In the first, start up the dummy server like this:</p><pre><code>./smtp-sink -c localhost:25 1000 100
</code></pre><p>With this in place, start throwing messages at this server with smtp-source in the other window:</p><pre><code>time ./smtp-source -s 20 -l 5120 -m 100 -c -f sender@example.com -t recipient@example.com localhost:25 100
