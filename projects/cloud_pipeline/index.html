<p>On the way to find a way to execute batch video and control the flow, I looked at the different solutions. Goal:</p><ul><li>preferrably using containers</li><li>lightweight: low overhead</li><li>easy to setup and maintain: the main goal of the project is to generate videos, this is limited and simple scope, the workflow should help to facilitate the management not make it more complicated</li></ul><p>Solutions retained:</p><ul><li>Airflow</li><li>Luigi</li><li>Argo</li><li>Dask</li></ul><div class="heading-wrapper h2"><h2 id="ideal-solution">Ideal solution</h2><a class="anchor" href="#ideal-solution" aria-labelledby="ideal-solution"><span hidden>#</span></a></div><p>Docker <code>Swarm</code> is easy to setup, <code>Kubernetes</code> much more complex, the goal is to find a way to execute jobs in a ligthweight environemnet, being able to track what is going on, trace of flow. Ideally a graphic intergfce, an easy way to define flow (yaml over python)</p>
